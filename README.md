The PKDD'99 Financial dataset contains information and transactions for loans, including both successful and unsuccessful cases. The primary task associated with this dataset is to predict the outcome of loans at the time of their initiation, specifically distinguishing between finished and unfinished loans.

Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 606 successful loans and 76 unsuccessful loans, along with relevant information and transaction details. Each loan is associated with a loan date (loan.date) and various attributes that provide insights into the loan's characteristics.
